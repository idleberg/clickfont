Tired of the installation procedure of fonts on Windows? ClickFont allows easy installation of TrueType, OpenType and PostScript fonts with just two mouse clicks, from anywhere in the system. All it takes is a right-click on a font.

The latest version supports installing fonts from folders, right-click and install. Easy.

Microsoft has added similiar functionality into Windows Vista and Windows 7. Unless you require the installation of many fonts, nested in folders, you can consider ClickFont obsolete on these systems.
